This application will use Web sockets to display data from a remote service in real time.  It gives visual feedback if the data falls outside of defined boundaries.  This software is limited to handling numeric data.

I threw this together because I wanted to play around with Web sockets and other technologies, and I was at a loss for a project idea.  I decided to simulate remote monitoring of an unspecified piece of equipment by returning randomly-generated data.

I'm considering writing multiple front ends.  The current one uses vanilla JavaScript; I might do another in Angular, etc.  I've done enough jQuery projects both personally and professionally, so there definitely won't be a jQuery front end.

With some modification, you can use this code as a starting point for a real application that does real-time web-based monitoring.

You're free to use this software to your heart's content, but because this isn't a "real" application, there will never be a release.  Please don't contact me about this project - I only respond to questions about projects that have releases.
